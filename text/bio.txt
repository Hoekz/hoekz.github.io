My family is amazing!  I've been blessed with two awesome parents who have guided and helped me through this life better than I could ever ask for.  As for my siblings, well, there's a lot of them.  Andrew (genius), Bethany (genius), Hannah (genius), and Matthew (guess).  They're all so incredibly smart and all of them have incredible, unique talents.  Andrew's a doctor, Bethany's a teacher, Hannah's an artist (and becoming a vet), and Matthew's got the potential to be an amazing mechanical engineer.  Unfortunately, the other family member, Sadie the dog, has since passed, but she passed on her legacy to our latest member, Echo.
I attended Twin Oaks Christian School from Pre-K to 6th grade and then Westminster Christian Academy until I graduated.  Right now, I'm at Missouri S&T pursuing a degree in computer science.
The love of my life is Violet Kouzes and though she won't admit it, she's the most beautiful and amazing woman ever to have lived (sorry Mom).  Every day I get to spend with her is a treasure and I am always astounded by her patience, kindness, and enthusiasm for everyone her life touches.
