My family is amazing!  I've been blessed with two awesome parents who have guided and helped me through this life better than I could ever ask for.  As for my siblings, well, there's a lot of them.  Andrew (genius), Bethany (genius), Hannah (genius), and Matthew (guess).  They're all so incredibly smart and all of them have incredible, unique talents.  Andrew's a doctor, Bethany's a teacher, Hannah's an artist (and becoming a vet), and Matthew's got the potential to be an amazing mechanical engineer.  Unfortunately, the other family member, Sadie the dog, has since passed, but she passed on her legacy to our latest member, Echo.
I attended Twin Oaks Christian School from Pre-K to 6th grade and then Westminster Christian Academy until I graduated.  Right now, I'm at Missouri S&T pursuing a degree in computer science.
The love of my life is Violet Kouzes and she helped redefine me in high school.  After being quite lost, not knowing if I even wanted to continue going through life, Violet brought me back and gave me purpose and I will love her forever for that.
